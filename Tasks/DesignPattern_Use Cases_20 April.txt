Use case for Singleton

*If we have license for only one connection for our database or our JDBC driver has trouble with multithreading, 
the Singleton makes sure that only one connection is made or that only one thread can access the connection at a time.



Use case for Prototype

*In UI whenever filter needs to be done,the result fetched from API will be cloned and used. When filter is removed, 
then UI will use the original result which got fetched from API. By Cloning cost of DB fetch is reduced.


Use case for Builder

*Two friends visiting a Burger shop and each ordering burger based on their interest.There they notice that burger making involves different processes 
like toasting the bread, creating patty for burger, making sauces and then everything is put together. 
In Programming Builder concept comes into picture in this point. Builder pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.
